# Documentation for DocScript                            {#mainpage}

This is the documentation for the DocScript framework.

It is good documentation because:

1. It exists.
2. I wrote it 🤯.
3. Everthing is documented (pretty easy since there's only one function)

The single provided function is `::accumulate_vector`.
